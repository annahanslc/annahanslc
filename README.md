## Welcome 🤗
#### The "Why" Behind My Work

I am a data scientist who is passionate about <b>empowering small businesses</b> through <b>data and machine learning</b>. 
Growing up in a small family business, I witnessed firsthand how they are the livelihood of families and the backbone of communities.
             
Just like how websites have become a necessity for all businesses big and small, I believe that data science and machine learning will soon be the same.
             
While I care deeply about helping small businesses succeed, I’m equally excited to **solve problems at any scale**, from lean startups to large organizations, where data can drive smarter decisions and stronger outcomes!

I value curiosity, empathy, and play — both in and out of work.
You’ll find me on the tennis court 🎾, experimenting with recipes 🧑‍🍳, or revisiting Harry Potter audiobooks for a dose of magic ⚡️.
