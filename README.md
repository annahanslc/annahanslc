## Welcome 🤗
#### Why I Do What I Do 

I am a data scientist who is passionate about <b>empowering small businesses</b> through <b>data and machine learning</b>. 
Growing up in a small family business, I witnessed firsthand how they are the livelihood of families and the backbone of communities.
             
Just like how websites have become a necessity for all businesses big and small, I believe that data science and machine learning will soon be the same.
Opportunities to **utilize data, ML and AI** are not exclusive to large corporations, in fact, they can have a **greater impact on small companies**.
             
I am driven to **create processes and applications** that will help take small businesses to the next level!

           <p>
When I'm not in front of the computer, you’ll likely find me on the <b>tennis court</b>, in the kitchen experimenting with HelloFresh or Marley Spoon recipes 🧑‍🍳, or in the car listening to <b>Harry Potter</b> audiobooks narrated by the legendary Jim Dale.
           </p>
           <p>
                I love to <b>travel</b>, especially to places where I can immerse myself in local culture away from the big cities.

One of my favorite trips was to **Italy**, where the people's kindness left a lasting impression on me! Like the café owner who used Google Translate to explain every sandwich ingredient, or a supermarket shopper who gave us her waiting ticket at the bread counter.
