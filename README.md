## Who Am I?
#### Welcome 🤗

I am a data scientist passionate about **empowering businesses through data and machine learning**.
Over the course of 10 years **managing retail and wholesale operations** in a small business, I saw firsthand how data is often collected but rarely leveraged effectively.

That experience fuels my mission: to **make efficient pipelines** that will allow fast iterations from incoming data to trained model to actionable recommendations. I strive to bridge the gap between raw data and real-business impact by transforming insights into user-friendly experiences that drive better decisions and measurable results.

In my free time, you’ll find me on the tennis court 🎾, experimenting with recipes 🧑‍🍳, or revisiting Harry Potter audiobooks for a dose of magic ⚡️.
