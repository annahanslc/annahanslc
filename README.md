## Welcome ü§ó

I am a data scientist passionate about **empowering businesses through data and machine learning**.
I **managed retail and wholesale operations** in a small business for over 10 years, where I witnessed firsthand how data-driven decisions can directly impact the bottom line.

That experience fuels my mission: to **make efficient pipelines** that will allow fast iterations from incoming data to trained model to actionable recommendations. I strive to bridge the gap between raw data and real-business impact by transforming insights into user-friendly experiences that drive better decisions and measurable results.

In my free time, you‚Äôll find me on the tennis court üéæ, experimenting with recipes üßë‚Äçüç≥, or revisiting Harry Potter audiobooks for a dose of magic ‚ö°Ô∏è.


## What I am Working On Now üî• 

[üéè Koi Fish Varieties and Traits Image Classification](https://github.com/annahanslc/koi-price-prediction) - Leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network with ResNet18 to perform multi-label, multi-class classification on images of koi fish.
